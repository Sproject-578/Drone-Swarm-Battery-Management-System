# Drone-Swarm-Battery-Management-System
This project develops a Drone Swarm Battery Management System using ROS 2, managing 12 drones (6 primary, 6 backup). When a droneâ€™s battery drops below 20%, the system pauses the mission, replaces it with a backup, and resumes seamlessly. Data is processed with Python and visualized in 3D using matplotlib.
